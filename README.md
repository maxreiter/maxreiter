# Max Reiter

Hello, my name is Max. I am a hobbyist developer in my mid-twenties from the greater Phoenix area. Professionally, I work as a desktop support specialist at the [Phoenix College](https://phoenixcollege.edu). In my spare time, I'm most likely writing code, listening to music, playing video games, or spending time with my lovely partner. :)
