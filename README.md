# Hey, I'm Max

I'm a hobbyist developer & IT professional living in the greater Phoenix area. I'm in my mid-twenties & currently use **she/they** pronouns. During the day, I work as a desktop support specialist at the [Phoenix College](https://phoenixcollege.edu). In my spare time, I'm most likely writing code, playing video games, or spending time with my lovely partner. :)
